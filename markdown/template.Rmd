## Setup and load data

The first step is to load some libraries and get the data loaded into R. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datapasta)
```

Start by selecting the data and using Ctrl-C to copy. Iâ€™ve only ever used the dataframe function from this package so lets see if that works. Put your cursor in a code chunk and type df_paste(). Run that line of code and it will paste the data on your clipboard into the chunk. Add a object name to assign the data to and run the chunk again.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
df_paste()
```
