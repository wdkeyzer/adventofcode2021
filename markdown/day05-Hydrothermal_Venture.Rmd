## Setup and load data

The first step is to load some libraries and get the data loaded into R.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datapasta)
```

Start by selecting the data and using Ctrl-C to copy.
I've only ever used the dataframe function from this package so lets see if that works.
Put your cursor in a code chunk and type df_paste().
Run that line of code and it will paste the data on your clipboard into the chunk.
Add a object name to assign the data to and run the chunk again.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
df_paste()
```

```{r }
data_raw <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,

We need to perform some data-cleaning to get the data in the right format.

```{r}
data <- data_raw %>%
  separate(., V2, into = c("y1", "x2"), sep = " -> ") %>% 
  rename(x1 = V1, y2 = V3) %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~as.numeric(.)))
```

## Part I

You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor!
These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.

They tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review.
For example:

    0,9 -> 5,9
    8,0 -> 0,8
    9,4 -> 3,4
    2,2 -> 2,1
    7,0 -> 7,4
    6,4 -> 2,0
    0,9 -> 2,9
    3,4 -> 1,4
    0,0 -> 8,8
    5,5 -> 8,2

Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -\> x2,y2 where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end.
These line segments include the points at both ends.
In other words:

An entry like 1,1 -\> 1,3 covers points 1,1, 1,2, and 1,3.
An entry like 9,7 -\> 7,7 covers points 9,7, 8,7, and 7,7.
For now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2.

So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:

    .......1..
    ..1....1..
    ..1....1..
    .......1..
    .112111211
    ..........
    ..........
    ..........
    ..........
    222111....

In this diagram, the top left corner is 0,0 and the bottom right corner is 9,9.
Each position is shown as the number of lines which cover that point or .
if no line covers that point.
The top-left pair of 1s, for example, comes from 2,2 -\> 2,1; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines 0,9 -\> 5,9 and 0,9 -\> 2,9.

To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap.
In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - a total of 5 points.

Consider only horizontal and vertical lines.
At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

Let's plot the vertical and horizontal lines of vents as segments.

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(x1 == x2 | y1 == y2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2)) +
  geom_segment()

```

Now we must figure out how to detect overlapping lines.
I think `map2()` and `unnest()` can handle this problem.

```{r}

data_nested <- data %>% 
  mutate(x = map2(x1, x2, seq)) %>%
  mutate(y = map2(y1, y2, seq))

hor_vertical <- data_nested %>% 
  filter(x1 == x2 | y1 == y2) %>%
  unnest(c(x, y))

hor_vertical%>% 
  count(x, y) %>% 
  summarize(sum(n>1))

```

## Part II

Unfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give you the full picture; you need to also consider diagonal lines.

Because of the limits of the hydrothermal vent mapping system, the lines in your list will only ever be horizontal, vertical, or a diagonal line at exactly 45 degrees.
In other words:

An entry like 1,1 -\> 3,3 covers points 1,1, 2,2, and 3,3.
An entry like 9,7 -\> 7,9 covers points 9,7, 8,8, and 7,9.
Considering all lines from the above example would now produce the following diagram:

    1.1....11.
    .111...2..
    ..2.1.111.
    ...1.2.2..
    .112313211
    ...1.2....
    ..1...1...
    .1.....1..
    1.......1.
    222111....

You still need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap.
In the above example, this is still anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - now a total of 12 points.

Consider all of the lines.
At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

```{r}

diagonal <- data_nested %>% 
  filter(!(x1 == x2 | y1 == y2)) %>%
  unnest(c(x, y))

diagonal %>% 
  bind_rows(hor_vertical) %>%
  count(x, y) %>% 
  summarize(sum(n>1))
```
