# Advent of Code

## 2021

This repo collects my attempts of my first participation to the Advent of Code contest. I will use R for solving the puzzles using reproducible code only.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## 2022

This year I will try to solve some puzzles again. First I will use **[this tutorial](https://colin-fraser.net/post/a-quick-tutorial-on-importing-data-from-advent-of-code-into-r/)** of Colin Fraser on importing data from AdventOfCode directly into R.
