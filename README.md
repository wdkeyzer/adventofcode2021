# Advent of Code 2021

This repo collects my attempts of my first participation to the Advent of Code contest. I will use R for solving the puzzles using reproducible code only.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
